# Task 1
## Problem statement :

## TO PREDICT THE STOCK PRICE OF ANY COMPANY USING LSTM.

This repository contains a Python-based deep learning model for predicting the future stock prices of Apple Inc. (AAPL) using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is particularly effective for time series forecasting tasks like stock price prediction.

In this project, we'll walk you through the steps to set up and run the Apple stock price prediction model. The model takes historical stock price data as input and uses LSTM to make predictions about future stock prices.

Dependencies

# Task 2
## Problem statement :

## Titanic Classification : Algorithm which tells whether the person will be save from sinking or not

This repository contains a Python-based classification algorithm that predicts whether a person aboard the Titanic would have survived the tragic sinking. The Titanic dataset is a popular dataset for machine learning beginners and is often used for introductory classification tasks.

In this project, we will walk you through the steps to set up and run the Titanic survival prediction model. The model takes passenger information as input and uses machine learning algorithms to make predictions about survival.
